										<h2>Our Goal</h2>
										<blockquote class="normBlockquote">
												Our vision is for monPlan is a website that both new and current
												Monash students could use as a tool to help them plan their course,
												while not neccesarilly forcing students to abide but the rules. But also
												providing a central platform in which students can also access information.
												So that students can print off and share their plan with a their course advisor.

										<h2>What our users thought</h2>
										<blockquote class="normBlockquote">
												Really really really good app! Has saved me heaps of time course planning.
										</blockquote>
										<blockquote class="altBlockquote">
												monPlan is so much nicer to use now. Last time I gave up making my course plan after 3
												semesters and thought it was easier to do in Excel. Now it's pretty gosh darn good - did
												my whole course in like two minutes. Would use it instead of Excel and that's like the highest of all honours
										</blockquote>
										<blockquote class="normBlockquote">
												Great new improvements with being able to load unit information and upload course maps!
										</blockquote>
										<blockquote class="altBlockquote">
												I really like the user interface you've created. It's beautiful! Looks awesome, isn't oversaturated
												with information and is easy to use
